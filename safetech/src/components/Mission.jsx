            <p className='mt-4'>Our goal is to empower young people for a better digital future. At  SafeTech India, we think every child should have the information necessary to confidently navigate the enormous digital terrain in today's increasingly connected world. Our goal is to light a spark as well as to educate. In our ideal future, both government employees and students attending private schools will be empowered and capable of becoming responsible digital citizens. We picture eager students exploring the wonders of technology while being aware of its drawbacks in classrooms. Children are forming connections and friendships on the internet while simultaneously protecting themselves from harm. We want to live in a world where digital literacy enables people to interact, learn, and create, therefore creating a better tomorrow for them.</p>
